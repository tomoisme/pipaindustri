                    The CPVC TEMPERFIP100 system includes a complete range of ball valves, butterfly valves, diaphragm
                    valves, check valves and sediment strainers, pipes and fittings for solvent welding to convey
                    industrial fluids under pressure at a maximum operating temperatures of 100&deg;C. The system
                    includes
                    also the Pimer Cleaners and the TEMPERGLUE Solvent Cements that assure long lasting high quality
                    joints. The entire range is made of CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins, classified to ASTM D1784-23447-B and
                    complying with DIN 8079, DIN 8080 abd EN ISO 15493 requirements for industrial processes plastic
                    pipeline system applications.

                <p>
                    <strong>High chemical resistance:</strong> the use of CORZAN&trade; resins, obtained from processes
                    of
                    post-chlorination of homopolymer PVC is a guarantee of high chemical resistance, especially to
                    strong
                    inorganic acids, bases and alkaline solutions, besides the optimal mechanical properties remain
                    unchanged during the transfer of hot industrial fluids. CORZAN&trade; resins offer total
                    compatibility
                    also for the transfer of treated and untreated drinking water as well as demineralised water and
                    spa
                    water for therapeutic and kinothreapeutic applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Optimal thermal stability:</strong> above all in the intermediate temperature range from
                    20&deg;C to
                    85&deg;C CPVC is ideal for industrial applications, guaranteeing optimal mechanical resistace, good
                    rigidity, very low coefficients of thermal expansion and optimal safety factors in service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Resistance to fire:</strong> CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins guarantee excellent resistance to
                    fire, thanks to
                    a
                    flame onset temperature of 482&deg;C and a high limit of oxygen index LOI = 60%. CORZAN&trade; CPVC
                    resins are classified VO, 5VB e 5VA ti Ul94.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Lifetime:</strong> CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins feature a high value in the circumferential
                    breaking
                    strength
                    (Minimum Required Strength MRS = 25.0 Mpa at 20&deg;C) and ensure extremely extended lifetime of
                    installations, without signs of significant mechanical or physical deterioration.
