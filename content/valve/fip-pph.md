The PPH range in homopolymer Propylene includes a complete series of ball valves, butterfly valves, diaphragm valves, check valves, sediment strainers, pipes and fittings for heat socket fusion, fittings for butt welding to be used in the construction of process and service lines for the convey under pressure of industrial fluids at maximum operating temperatures of 100&deg;C.

The entire range is made of the last generation of homopolymenr polypropylene resins MRS 100 (PPH 100) according the classification DIN 8077-8078, DIN 16962 and approved by DIBT (Deutsche Insitut fur Bautechnik) for use in industria processes.

#### Main properties and characteristics:

**High chemical resistance:** the use of PPH resins guarantees excellent chemical resistance especially in case of halogens and alkaline solutions and enables constant optimal mechanical properties thanks to the use of special additives PPH resins are totally compatible also for the convey of raw and drinking water, demineralised water and spa water for therapeutic and kinotherapeutic applications.

**Optimal thermal stability:** mainly in the intermediate temperature range from 10&deg;C to 80&deg;C PPH finds its ideal application in industry guaranteeing excellent mechanical and impact resistance with high safety factors.

**Lifetime:** PPH resins have a high value in the cirferential breaking strength (Minimum Required Strength MRS = 10.0 Mpa at 20&deg;C) and ensure extremely extended lifetime of installations withought signs of significant mechanical or physical deterioration.
