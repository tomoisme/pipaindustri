The range in PVDF includes a complete series of ball valves, butterfly valves, diaphragm valves, check valves, pipes and fittings for heat socket fusion, to be used in the construction of process lines and service lines to convey industrial fluids in the operating temperature range from -40&deg;C to 140&deg;C. The entire range is produced in SOLEF&trade; resins by SOLVAY S.A. classified according to ASTM D 3222 and compliant with requirements stated in ISO/WD 10931 for the use of PVDF pipeline systems in industrial processes.

### Main properties and characteristics:

**Excellent chemical resistance:** The characteristics of PVDF remain unchanged in a temperature range of -40&deg;C to +140&deg;C. The PVDF pipeline systems is therefore ideal for all applications where high operating temperatures are required, with an extremely low level of fluid contamination and optimal resistance to aging under the effect of atmospheric agents and UV radiation.

**Fire resistance:** SOLEF&trade; resins guarantee optimal fire resistance without the need for flame retardants (Limit of Oxygen Index, LOI=44%). Also, smoke emissions during combustion are moderate. SOLEF&trade; PVDF resins are classified UL-94, class V-O.

**Purity:** SOLEF&trade; PVDF resin is an extremely pure polymer, which unlike other plastic materials does not contain stabilizers, plastifiers, lubricants or flame retardants. It is therefore ideal to convey ultra-pure water and chemicals, where contamination-free properties are required with respect to the conveyed fluid.

**Lifetime:** SOLEF&trade; PVDF resins feature a high value in the circumferential breaking strength (Minimum Required Strength MRS=25.0 MPa at 20&deg;C) and ensure extremely extended lifetime of installations, without signs of significant mechanical or physical deterioration.
