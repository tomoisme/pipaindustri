The uPVC range includes ball valves, butterfly valves, diaphragm valves as well as check valves, sediment strainers, air release, foot valves, angle seat valves to be used in the construction of process and service lines to convey industrial fluids at maximum operating temperatures of 60&deg;C.

The entire range is produced using uPVC resins complying with the standards UNI EN 1452 and inobservance to the requirements of DIN 8063 and EN ISO 15493 for the use of plastic pipes in industrial processes.

#### Main properties and characteristics:

**Good chemical resistance:** uPVC resins guarantee excellent chemical resistance with regard to most acids and alkalis, aliphatic hydrocarbons and saline solutions. uPVC resins are also totally compatible for the handling of food grade fluids, treated and untreated drinking water as well as demineralised water according to current national and internatinoal standards.

**Good thermal stability:** Mostly in the intermediate temperature range between 20&deg;C and 50&deg;C, uPVC finds its ideal application in industrial and water supplies, assuring optimal performance in terms of mechanical resistance, good rigidity, low coefficients of thermal expansion and optimal safety factors in service.

**Lifetime:** uPVC resins feature is an high value in the material strength (Minimum Reuquired Strength MRS = 25.0 Mpa at 20&deg;C) and an extremely extended lifetime.
