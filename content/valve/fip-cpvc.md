The CPVC TEMPERFIP100 system includes a complete range of ball valves, butterfly valves, diaphragm valves, check valves and sediment strainers, pipes and fittings for solvent welding to convey industrial fluids under pressure at a maximum operating temperatures of 100&deg;C. The system includes also the Pimer Cleaners and the TEMPERGLUE Solvent Cements that assure long lasting high quality joints. The entire range is made of CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins, classified to ASTM D1784-23447-B and complying with DIN 8079, DIN 8080 abd EN ISO 15493 requirements for industrial processes plastic pipeline system applications.

#### Main properties and characteristics:

**High chemical resistance:** the use of CORZAN&trade; resins, obtained from processes of post-chlorination of homopolymer PVC is a guarantee of high chemical resistance, especially to strong inorganic acids, bases and alkaline solutions, besides the optimal mechanical properties remain unchanged during the transfer of hot industrial fluids. CORZAN&trade; resins offer total compatibility also for the transfer of treated and untreated drinking water as well as demineralised water and spa water for therapeutic and kinothreapeutic applications.

**Optimal thermal stability:** above all in the intermediate temperature range from 20&deg;C to 85&deg;C CPVC is ideal for industrial applications, guaranteeing optimal mechanical resistace, good rigidity, very low coefficients of thermal expansion and optimal safety factors in service.

**Resistance to fire:** CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins guarantee excellent resistance to fire, thanks to a flame onset temperature of 482&deg;C and a high limit of oxygen index LOI = 60%. CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins are classified VO, 5VB e 5VA ti Ul94.

**Lifetime:** CORZAN&trade; CPVC resins feature a high value in the circumferential breaking strength (Minimum Required Strength MRS = 25.0 Mpa at 20&deg;C) and ensure extremely extended lifetime of installations, without signs of significant mechanical or physical deterioration.
